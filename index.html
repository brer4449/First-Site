            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p> My name is Brendan Erickson and I just moved to the DC area from California in August! I am excited to be on the East coast and even more excited to have started this boot camp! It has been a dream of mine for a while now to be a developer but I have always found an excuse to not try. I am eager to learn all that I can about web development and even the backend data analysis!</p>
            <p>My previous fields of study were International Affairs and Chinese, and then Education. While I very much enjoyed all of these fields, the study of computer science always interested me more. I have always loved computers and wanted to know more about them and now I have that opportunity! When I'm not behind a keyboard I can be found enjoying long walks on the beach and watching sunsets.</p>
